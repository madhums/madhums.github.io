  Big-Cloud migration
  <span class="post-meta pull-right">2024 - present</span>
</h2>

I started out with a new idea this year of helping tech companies reduce their cloud costs. I successfully helped a client move away from MongoDB atlas to another provider with self-managed infra, this reduced their costs by 90%. If you are one of those companies using Big-Cloud and tired of paying rediculously high amounts of cloud bills and want to save some of these costs, feel free to reach out to me.

  Waiting for Cows
  <span class="post-meta pull-right">2022 - 2025</span>
</h2>

Waiting for Cows is an interactive storytelling project that explores the complex relationship between humans, animals and technology. My role as a creative coder was to gather all the data from the farm, build custom interfaces for the farmer and give a real time simulation at the art installation.

This project was nominated for the 2025 Gouden Kalf (Dutch Oscars) in the Digital Culture Production category.
