  Big-Cloud migration
  <span class="post-meta pull-right">2024 - present</span>
</h2>

I started out with a new idea this year of helping tech companies reduce their cloud costs. Simply moving away from BigCloud providers to other cloud providers in itself reduces the costs significantly. I successfully helped a client move away from MongoDB atlas to another provider with self-managed infra, this reduced their costs by 90%. If you are one of those companies using AWS/Google/MS and want to save some costs, feel free to reach out to me.
