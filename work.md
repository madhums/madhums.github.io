  Wable

Wable wants to improve accessability to drinking water by decentralising services with a high regard to adopt regenerative and sustainable practices that aid ecological and social wellbeing. It envisions to empower the community and integrate water as a social commodity, thus benefiting people and planet.

  Redcross
  <span class="post-meta pull-right">2019 - present</span>
</h2>

During [hackathon for good](https://www.hackathonforgood.org/) in June 2019, we built an application to help volunteers in the field to assess damange and map flood extents easily, where disasters have happened. This took off and I've been volunteering and helping out with the data team at 510.
