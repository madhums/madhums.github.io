Hi, I am Madhu, welcome to my site! I am a Freelance Full stack Programmer and a UX Designer currently living in Delft.

## What do I do?

I help startups, non-profits and communities with their digital presence and scaling, so that it reaches the masses who find it meaningful and engaging. For this, I use web and mobile technologies.

## How do I do it?

I have more than a decade of experience in building applications.

I _Brainstorm_ ideas with product owners, come up with user stories. _Sketch_ the ideas, come up with _user flows_ (I sometimes use parts of [google design sprint](http://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com) here). _Design_ or create _wireframe_ if necessary and _code_ it.

I use [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (OSS) to implement the solutions. I can program in `Ruby`, `JavaScript`, `Typescript`, `Python` (and more) languages. I have used many frameworks, databases, technologies and services.

If what I do intrigues you, whether it's a completely new idea or an already existing application, drop me a line and I shall get back to you!
