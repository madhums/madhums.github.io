Hi, I am Madhu, welcome to my site! I am a Freelance Full stack Programmer and a UX Designer currently living in Delft. I love travelling and people. I care about our environment, human & animal rights and wellbeing of everyone and everything. I believe anything is possible (in the realms of our reality ofcourse) and I like to work on stuff that creates a positive impact on our society.

## What do I do?

I help startups to build scalable businesses, communities and applications using web and mobile technologies.

## How do I do it?

I have more than a decade of experience in building applications.

I _Brainstorm_ ideas with product owners, come up with user stories. _Sketch_ the ideas, come up with _user flows_ (I sometimes use parts of [google design sprint](http://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com) here). _Design_ or create _wireframe_ if necessary and _code_ it.

I use [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (OSS) to implement the solutions. I can program in `JavaScript`, `Typescript`, `Python`, `Go` languages. I have used many frameworks, databases, technologies and services.

If what I do intrigues you, whether it's a completely new idea or an already existing application, drop me a line and I shall get back to you!
